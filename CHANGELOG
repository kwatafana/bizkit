PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  Like it or not, the internet is now an integral part of society.
  This is not surprising, it gives us magical abilities and
  connects everyone (and things) in “real time”.

  Small and Mid-size Enterprises (SMEs) today can tap into the
  magic of the internet, giving their business new abilities that
  make them stand out to customers and enhance their day-to-day
  operations.

  This is why we created BizKit – A suite of digital business
  tools for modern Small and medium-sized enterprises.

GOALS:
  x Have a suite of software that enables an SME to enhance its day-
    to day operations.
  x Form a marketplace from the SMEs that use __bizkit__.
  x Make traditional ways of running an SME obsolete.
  x Allow any individual to create and run a business without any
    any censorship or other kinds of restrictions.
  x Freedom in commerce.
  x Have new revolutionary ideas and tools to operate an SME.

NON-GOALS
  x Quick cash
